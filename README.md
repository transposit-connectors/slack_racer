## Summary

SlackRacer uses the **commands** and **chat:write:bot** scopes to provide a light copy of the popular TypeRacer game. 

Initiate a race with the **/race** slash command and when the dialog box pops up, copy the text by hand as fast as possible. 

Afterwards the bot will reply with your WPM and correctness. Since there is no real-time feedback with Slack, errors in your submission will not be known until you submit. Make sure to be 100% accurate! Also, the system is heavily honor-based because
of api limitations!
